          <li>
            3.1 Where the parties have agreed for the Company to supply Goods to the Customer, delivery of the Goods shall take place at the Company's premises in normal business hours (unless other agreed in writing by the parties) and the Customer shall take delivery of the Goods within 7 days of the Company giving the Customer notice that the Goods are ready for delivery. Any dates specified by the Company for delivery of the Goods are intended to be an estimate only and time for delivery shall not be of the essence. If no dates are so specified, delivery will be within a reasonable time.

          <li>
            3.2 If for any reason the Customer does not take delivery of any of the Goods when they are ready for delivery or the Company is unable to deliver the Goods on time due to the Customer's default, then the Goods will be deemed to have been delivered, risk passing to the Customer (including for loss or damage caused by the Company's negligence) and the Company may (a) store the Goods until actual delivery whereupon the Customer will be liable for all related costs and expenses (including storage, re-delivery and insurance); or (b) sell the Goods at the best price readily obtainable and after deduction of all reasonable storage and selling expenses, charge the Customer for any shortfall below the Contract price.

          <li>
            3.4 Where the Company is to perform Services at the Customer's premises, the Customer shall procure safe access to the premises and the provision of adequate power, lighting, heating and other such facilities or supplies for the Company's employees or agents in accordance with the demands of any applicable legislation and as the Company shall reasonably require. 
          </li>
          <li>
            3.5 The Services will be deemed to be completed and the relevant element of the Contract price to be due (a) when the Company issues a written notice to the Customer confirming such completion; or (b) if the Company is available to perform the Services but is prevented from doing so by reason of the lack of relevant assistance from the Customer (such as lack of availability of test components or parts from the Customer); and/or the condition of the Customer premises on the site at which the Services are to be provided and/or the facilities at or the services available therein at the time agreed for the provision of the Services.
